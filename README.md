## SnooWrapArchive is a local tool to automatically archive images from subreddits. Day by day, hour by hour.

As of now some tinkering is needed in order to get it working, namely, a config.js file containing username and password for the API as well as a uri for mongodb, since this project was made with only learning in mind I may have to provide a tutorial at a later date on how to do that.
